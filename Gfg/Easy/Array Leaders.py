#You are given an array arr of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. The rightmost element is always a leader.
#Examples:
#Input: arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
#Output: [17, 5, 2]
#Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.

                leaders.append(arr[i])
                max_right = arr[i]
